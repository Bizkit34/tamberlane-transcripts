CAT: Right then; tell me your "foolproof plan" once more?
PIPER: So I'm at the Sovereign Festival in this pretty dress.
PIPER: Even though you're making me clean the latrines.
PIPER: Which make NO SENSE, by the way.
CAT: Save it for the judge, kid.
PIPER: Well, whenever someone admires my dress, I can be all...

PIPER: "Oh, golly gosh, mister! Isn't my dress so <i>pretty?</i>"

PIPER: "My mummy made it! Isn't she <i>ever</i> so talented? I bet your daughter would look <i>adorable</i> in one!"

PIPER: "What a crazy coincidence!"
PIPER: "She's selling them on the corner of Trades &amp; Crafts!"
PIPER: "Two booths down from the pies!"
CAT: And this is how you're going to get out of being grounded?
PIPER: FOOLPROOF!
